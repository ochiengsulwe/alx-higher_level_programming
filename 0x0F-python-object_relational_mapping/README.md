# Python - Object-relational mapping
The ain of this project was to allow me understand and appreciate the beauty
of abstraction brought by the usage of ORMs.

The project didn't shy off from letting me know of the flipside of using ORMs
too: the syntax.
It left me to choose either ORMs or without ORMs; where I write the SQL queries
within my code.

## MySQLdb
This is a python module that provides an intrface to the MysQL database server.
In a nutshell, it is a library that allows Python programs to communicate with
MySQL database.
It allows me to write/incorporate SQL syntax within my Python code. With this
comes speed and efficiency at runtime.

## SQLAlchemy
This is a pyhton module that provides an interface to MySQL database, but with a high level of abstraction.
What this means is that, I don't have to remember the SQl syntax, but at least
understand what it can do. On the flip side, I have to learn and know the sytax
of SQLAlchemy.
SQLAlchemy is an ORM.

## Python Virtual Environments
These are like `a room in a house` which provides me with the features of the
general house, but still I am free to stuff things into this specific room.
Virtual envirnments help me when I am dealing with different Pyhton projects, to
define different and specific needs of my project, without bringing confusion at
the global level.

## Conclusion
I have to say that, I prefer working with MySQLdb, as opposed to SQLAlchemy. Not
because of any specific reason, but because I love working with databases
directly, with no abstraction.
Virtual envirnments, are a blessing on their on way.
